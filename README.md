### The project
The system provides a tool for event organizers to create events and mark the eventâ€™s services and points of interest on a map. The event participant can use app with the map to find the services and sends location data to the service. The participant can see the current heatmap of the event area. Participant can use this data for example to pick a less crowded toilet. The organizer can view the heatmaps for the entire duration of the event and use this data to optimize the locations of the services and give better guidance to participants.
